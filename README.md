# BlenderSA2Support
An addon for Blender 2.8, which adds exporting options for .sa2mdl, .sa2bmdl, .sa2lvl and .sa2blvl, so that entire SA2 stages can be created inside Blender without needing external stage editors

Still in development, usage unadvised

How to install:
  1. download the repo as a zip
  2. open blender 2.8, open the preferences and go to the addon tab
  3. hit install in the top right
  4. navigate to the zip, then select it
  5. if the addon didnt appear in the addon list, look up "SA2 Model formats support"
  6. enable the addon
  7. Enjoy!
